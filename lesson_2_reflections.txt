What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialize a repository, git creates a hidden directory called .git with the necessary metadata. It is needed for tracking repository files and history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  I suppose staging area is a virtual space, unlike repository and working directory.It shows the files that can be committed.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  Just filling the staging area only with the files I want to commit, and assuring they contain logically related changes.
